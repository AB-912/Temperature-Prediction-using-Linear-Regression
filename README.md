# Temperature-Prediction using Linear Regression
This Project is about Temperature prediction using machine learning models.
The Project is made by Abhishek Bhattacharyya and Venkatesh Durvasula.

Temperature prediction is the task of predicting the temperature of the atmosphere at a future time and a speciÔ¨Åed location. There are many types of machine learning algorithms to predict the temperature, of which one important algorithm in predicting the temperature is Linear Regression. In this project, we are predicting temperature at a particular instant, given other parameters (like dew, humidity, sea level pressure, etc.) using a linear regression model.
